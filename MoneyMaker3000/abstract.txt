Future stock price prediction has been a popular application for machine learning models 
since the rise of modern machine learning. The MoneyMaker3000 is an XGBoost-based machine 
learning model designed to do just this. It will be trained on a variety of big tech 
stock data pulled from yahoo finance, as well as data from other sources when it is needed.
Once trained the model will be applied to predict the future price of a desired tech 
stock. After achieving acceptable results the model will be presented through a web app 
that allows the user to search/select a stock ticker symbol and the model will be used to 
make predictions of the future stock price at set intervals into the future: one day, week, 
and month.
